# autocnn_unsup
Matlab scripts implementing the model from http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00611 on unsupervised layer-wise training of a convolution neural network based on recursive autoconvolution (AutoCNN)

The rest of the scripts is coming

## Requirements
For faster filters learning it's highly recommended to use VLFeat (http://www.vlfeat.org/), and for faster forward pass - MatConvNet (http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/). Although, in the scripts there is still an option to use built-in Matlab implementations.

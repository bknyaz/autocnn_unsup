# autocnn_unsup
Matlab scripts implementing the model from http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00611 on unsupervised layer-wise training of a convolution neural network based on recursive autoconvolution (AutoCNN)

## Requirements
To learn filters it's highly recommended to install VLFeat (http://www.vlfeat.org/), and for forward pass MatConvNet (http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/)

The rest of the scripts is coming
